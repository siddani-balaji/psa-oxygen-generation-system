## Overview
This project focuses on the design and working of a Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) system used for oxygen generation from atmospheric air.

## Objective
To design a small-scale PSA system that separates oxygen from air using adsorption and pressure swing cycles.

## System Components
- Air compressor
- Adsorption columns
- Zeolite molecular sieve
- Solenoid / control valves
- Pressure regulators and gauges
- Control system

## Working Principle
Compressed air is passed through a zeolite-filled adsorption column where nitrogen is adsorbed under high pressure. 
During pressure reduction, nitrogen is released, allowing continuous oxygen production through cyclic operation.

## My Contribution
- System design and component selection
- Understanding PSA cycle and adsorption process
- Assembly and testing of the setup

## Applications
- Medical oxygen supply
- Industrial oxygen generation
- Gas separation processes
